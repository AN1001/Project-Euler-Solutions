My solutions to a few of the problems on project Euler.

Note that I have only attempted few problems that seemed interesting to me and not too easy (not just brute force),

Most problems are solved in C++ with one solved in Rust and a few solved with paper (notes shown in a .MD file)


C++ compiled with G++:

```Apple clang version 15.0.0 (clang-1500.3.9.4)```
